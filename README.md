Open Accountability Bot

### `WARNING` Sloppy Code Ahead

This was cobble together in the span of a couple of hours during a weekend, so the code is very _spaghetti-esque_.

### Getting started

Just run `yarn start`

#### Starting a local development tunnel

Run `yarn tunnel <your-subdomain>`.

This will generate a local tunnel in the form of `<your-subdomain>.localtunnel.me` which you can plug into [your Slack bot's](https://api.slack.com/apps) request URL.
